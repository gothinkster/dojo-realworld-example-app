# dojo2-realworld

This project was generated with the [Dojo CLI](https://github.com/dojo/cli) & [Dojo CLI create app command](https://github.com/dojo/cli-create-app).

## Build

Run `dojo build` to create a production build for the project. The built artifacts will be stored in the `dist` directory.

## Development server

Run `dojo build -w` to create a development build and start a development server. By default the server runs on port `9999`, navigate to `http://localhost:9999/`.

If port `9999` is already in use, the next available port in the `9990:9999` range (working backwards) will be used. The selected port is output to the console at the start of the `dojo build -w` process. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `dojo test` to run the projects unit tests. These tests are located in the `tests/unit` directory.

## Running functional tests

Run `dojo test -f` to run the projects functional tests. These tests are located in the `tests/functional` directory.

## Further help

To get help for these commands and more, run `dojo` on the command line.
