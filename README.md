# ![Dojo Example App](logo.png)

> ### Dojo codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://dojo-2-realworld.firebaseapp.com) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://dojo-realworld.netlify.app)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged full-stack progressive web application built with Dojo including automatic code splitting by route, CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, build time rendering and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the Dojo community style guides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other front-ends/back-ends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repository.

# How it works

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repository
- `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the [local server](http://localhost:9999) with watch and hot reload

The local web server uses port 9999.

For a production build of the application:

- `npm run build` to build the output into the `output/dist` directory.

To run the tests run `npm run test`
